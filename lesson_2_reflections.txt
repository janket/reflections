diff -u 	comparing tow files which are not in the same repository

ls -a 		list all files (also hidden, e.g. .git) which are in the currend dicrectory

git init	initialize (or create) a new, empty Git repository
			git does not create any commmit when the repository is first created

git status	show all files whicht are untracked by Git at the moment

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git creates an empty, hidden map (.git), but does not create any commit for files. This need to be done manually

git commit	create a commit
	BUT
	better to store multiple files in a 'Staging area' to match them into one commit
git add		add files to the 'Staging area'

How is the staging area differnt from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area collects a manual selection of the files which can be found in the working directory, but the files are
not sored in the repository yet. This helps to gain control over which files to add in one single commit.
