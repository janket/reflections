Basic commands for command control (cmd)
cd.. or cd~				shorten directory path shown in cmd window by 1
cd "name of directory"			increase length of directory path shown in cmd by 1
mkdir "name of directory"		create a new direcory
copy nul > "name of file.txt"		create an empty txt file
start notepad "name of file.txt"	open txt file with notepad

How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
1) insert directory path in cmd
2) FC "name of first file" "name of second file"	both files need to be in the same directory

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmmer in the long term?
differences in versions could be detected easily, debugging is more quick
	e.g. dropbox (30 days), google drive (unlimited)

version
control
systems

	Any Editor	use offline	manual save

manual	   Yes		   Yes		   Yes
saving

dropbox	   Yes		   No		   No

google	   No		   No		   No
drive

Git	   Yes		   Yes		   Yes

SVN	   Yes		   No		   Yes
_________________

definition: Commit
	save a version with a short comment on the things changed (e.g. "color of ojects has changed")
	a commit may contain several files at one time, if they are interrelated

cmd commands on commits
git log		show all commits of a file (changes made)
			author, date, sort of change (description)

git diff	compare different versions of a file whithin Git (via Git ID)


What are pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit instead of saving every version?
automatically saving every version can lead to a mess of versions with only small changes, making it harder
to find an compare the really important versions from history

cmd commands on repositories
git log --stat		statisitics about which files are changed within a commit

Why does some version control systems allow saving multiple files in one commit, rather than saving each file
seperately?
Some files could be interrelated to form the final program. It is important to detect changes in the whole program
and not just in one file.

_________________
git clone	clone a whole repository form another location

git config --globar color.ui auto	to geht colored diff output

q	quit git log or git diff

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
get commit ids with git log
compare commit ids with git diff

git checkout	resetting the verison of the game temporarilary to an earlier version

how might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
With git checkout, it is easy to run an older version of the code, such that breaks could be undone without debugging.

mv "document name" "new document name"		move and change name of file in a directory

git config --global core.editor "path and editor name -n -w" 	set a new standard code editor
							-n	open editor in a new window
							-w	force the editor to close window before continuing in gitbash
