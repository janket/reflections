use of GitHub

git remote	show all existing remotes	

git remote add "name of remote" "https: githubadress"	create new remote link to github

git remote -v 	show more information on a remote connection (verbose) as the remote adress

git push "name of remote" "branch of repository"	choose which branch or the repositroy to push towards github

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You might not want to share all of your changes with others, so you will have more control of
what you want to share with others if you pull manually
